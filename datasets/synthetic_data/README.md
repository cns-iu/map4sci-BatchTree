## Generate Synthetic Trees

Make sure all python packages are available in your machine. Then, run the following command.
```
$ python rand_tree.py 1000
```
Here, `1000` is the number of nodes in the synthetic tree. This command will generate an output file representing the tree in matrix market format. Output tree will be stored in synthetictree_1000.mtx and output labels will be stored in syntheticlabel_1000.labels file.
